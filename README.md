# FLDPCR-kTCR
 This repository implements the $k$-ary Tree-based Differentially Private Continuous Release (kTCR) model for FLDPCR framework, improving privacy and accuracy. It minimizes errors using Variance Optimal Estimation (VOE) and optimizes privacy budget allocation via a convex optimization approach.
