# FLDPCR-kTCR
# Code for "Enhancing Federated Learning with Differentially Private Continuous Data Release via k-Ary Trees"

The project is the code for the paper **"Enhancing Federated Learning with Differentially Private Continuous Data Release via k-Ary Trees"**.
In this project, we design a novel differential privacy continuous data release (DPCR) model called augmented BIT-based continuous data release (AuBCR) model.

Thanks to the open sourced [**FLDPCR framework**](https://github.com/imcjp/FLDPCR). Our work is conducted based on the [**FLDPCR framework**]. By introducing the augmented policy matrix, designing the BIT-based DPCR algorithm with consistency (BCRC), and proposing the meta-factor approach, our AuBCR effectively boosts the learning accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art DPCR models.

The software environment of the source code requires **Python3**, and parts of the required packages are as follows:
* numpy==1.23.3
* scipy==1.9.1
* **opacus==1.1.2**
* torch
* torchaudio
* torchvision

#### Instructions:

1. Our proposed AuBCR model is implemented in the file [**aubcr.py**](dpcrpy/bitMethods/aubcr.py).
2. The design of AuBCR is based on a rigorous theoretical derivation. Limited by the length of the paper, we show the relevant theoretical derivations in [**proof.pdf**](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx8/10206/4358835/10711967/supp1-3477325.pdf).
3. FL-DPCR framework is implemented in the folder "fldpcr", including server for the collaborator (server.py) and client for the participants (priClient.py for private FL and flClient.py for non-private FL), as well as some auxiliary codes in folder "utils".
4. We provide a script "main.m" to help users quickly implement FL-DPCR using our code. In this script, we provide multiple DPCR models, including SimpleMech, TwoLevel, BinMech, FDA, BCRG, ABCRG as well as our proposed AuBCRComp (note: AuBCR means $\left( k,N \right)$-AuBCR Model that supports $2^k$ releases).
5. The folder "dpcrpy" and "opacus_dpcr" are for implementing DPCR and private learning with DPCR. They are from [**Opacus-DPCR**](https://github.com/imcjp/Opacus-DPCR).
